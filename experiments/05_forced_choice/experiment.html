        Welcome!
        <br>

        On the following screens, you will see pairs of people having small conversations, and you will be asked to answer some questions about their discussion. It should take about 5 minutes in all.

        On the following screens you'll see pairs of characters in certain situations, where one of them asks a question.
        <br>
        <br>
        The other person checks their phone and responds based on the information they see there.
        <br>
        <br>
        You'll then be presented with two phone pictures. In one of them, you can see the screen and the details of what's on it. The other one is turned upside down.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your task is to guess which of the two phones is the one the second person is looking at, based on what the person is saying in the picture. As a general rule, you'll select the phone with the visible screen if you think that the information on the screen fits what is being said. If you think that the information visible on the screen does <strong>not</strong> fit with what the person says, you'll select the phone that's turned upside down, the screen of which <strong>you</strong> cannot see, but the person answering the question can.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that <strong>just one of the pictures</strong> goes with what the second person responds. So you should only choose the phone that's upside down  if you don't think the person giving the answer would have said what they did if they had been looking at the visible phone screen, and must instead have been looking at a screen with different information on it, which you cannot see.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next screen will show an example situation, and explain your task in more detail.
